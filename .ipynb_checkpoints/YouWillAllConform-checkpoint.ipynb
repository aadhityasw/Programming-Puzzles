    "Let’s say we have a whole bunch of people in line waiting to see a baseball game.  They are all hometown fans and each person has a team cap and is wearing it.  However, not all of them are wearing the caps in the same way – some are wearing their caps in the normal way, and some are wearing them backwards.People have different definitions of normal and backwards but you, the gatekeeper thinks that the cap on the left below is being normally worn and the one on the right is being worn backwards.\n",
    "You are the gatekeeper and can only let them in to the stadium if the entire group has their caps on in the same way – either all forwards or all backwards.  Because everyone has different definitions of forward and backward, you can’t tell them to wear their cap forwards or backwards. You can only tell them to flip their caps. The good news is that each person knows what position they are in the line, starting with the first person having position 0 and the last one position n – 1.\n",
